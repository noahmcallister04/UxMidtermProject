## The Problem
For this Midterm Project I identified two problems with the "Manage Classes" section in Myzou.

1. The first problem I had was this extremely large drop down menu that goes over every individual subject offered at Mizzou.

**Why is this bad UX?:**
Long dropdown lists require excessive scrolling and be difficult to navigate. The drop down menu always starts from alphabetical order, which can be frustrating when signing up for multiple classes from the bottom of the list. When students are looking for electives outside of their major this can overwhelm users, making it difficult to make a decision.

2. The second problem I had was in a scenario where a user is adding multiple classes from the same subject. When doing so the user must go through the entire search process each time. **Below shows the process of adding two classes from the same subject. Note how many screen I had to go through:**

**Why is this bad UX?:**
Often for a semester, a student will enroll for multiple classes under the same subject. In order to do it on this system, they must go through the entire search process with multiple screens multiple times leading to redundency and a waste of time. This system is inefficient because it forces users to repeat the same steps and wastes time and effort, which can be frustrating for the user.

## Proposed Solution

1. To fix the first issue, the drop down list can be nested into categories. This would allow the initial drop down list to become smaller and help guide user decisions by narrowing down the list. The result would be less overwhelming and allow for quicker selection for items further down on the list. **Implementing this would look roughly like the following:**

2. The fix to the second issue is actually pretty simple. After adding the class, a button should be added to "Continue Previous Search". This would skip the search process if the user knows they'll be adding a class from the same subject. The user would save time and frustration. **This is what a rough implementation would look like:**
