## The Problem
For this Midterm Project I identified three problems with the "Manage Classes" section in Myzou.

1. The first problem I had was this extremely large drop down menu that goes over every individual subject offered at Mizzou.

**Why is this bad UX?:**
Long dropdown lists require excessive scrolling and be difficult to navigate. The drop down menu always starts from alphabetical order, which can be frustrating when signing up for multiple classes from the bottom of the list. When students are looking for electives outside of their major this can overwhelm users, making it difficult to make a decision.

## Proposed Solution

1. To fix the first issue, the drop down list can be nested into categories. This would allow the initial drop down list to become smaller and help guide user decisions by narrowing down the list. The result would be less overwhelming and allow for quicker selection for items further down on the list. **Implementing this would look like the following:**
